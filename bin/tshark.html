<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p><strong>TShark</strong> is a network protocol analyzer.  It lets you capture packet
data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved
capture file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the
standard output or writing the packets to a file.  <strong>TShark</strong>'s native
capture file format is <strong>libpcap</strong> format, which is also the format used
by <strong>tcpdump</strong> and various other tools.</p>
<p>Without any options set, <strong>TShark</strong> will work much like <strong>tcpdump</strong>. It will
use the pcap library to capture traffic from the first available network
interface and displays a summary line on stdout for each received packet.</p>
<p><strong>TShark</strong> is able to detect, read and write the same capture files that
are supported by <strong>Wireshark</strong>.
The input file doesn't need a specific filename extension; the file
format and an optional gzip compression will be automatically detected.
Near the beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of <code>wireshark(1)</code> or
<a href="http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html">http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html</a>
is a detailed description of the way <strong>Wireshark</strong> handles this, which is
the same way <strong>Tshark</strong> handles this.</p>
<p>Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present, <strong>TShark</strong> will compile, but will
be unable to read compressed files.</p>
<p>If the <strong>-w</strong> option is not specified, <strong>TShark</strong> writes to the standard
output the text of a decoded form of the packets it captures or reads.
If the <strong>-w</strong> option is specified, <strong>TShark</strong> writes to the file
specified by that option the raw data of the packets, along with the
packets' time stamps.</p>
<p>When writing a decoded form of packets, <strong>TShark</strong> writes, by
default, a summary line containing the fields specified by the
preferences file (which are also the fields displayed in the packet list
pane in <strong>Wireshark</strong>), although if it's writing packets as it captures
them, rather than writing packets from a saved capture file, it won't
show the &quot;frame number&quot; field.  If the <strong>-V</strong> option is specified, it
writes instead a view of the details of the packet, showing all the
fields of all protocols in the packet.</p>
<p>If you want to write the decoded form of packets to a file, run
<strong>TShark</strong> without the <strong>-w</strong> option, and redirect its standard output to
the file (do <em>not</em> use the <strong>-w</strong> option).</p>
<p>When writing packets to a file, <strong>TShark</strong>, by default, writes the
file in <strong>libpcap</strong> format, and writes all of the packets it sees to the
output file.  The <strong>-F</strong> option can be used to specify the format in which
to write the file. This list of available file formats is displayed by
the <strong>-F</strong> flag without a value. However, you can't specify a file format
for a live capture.</p>
<p>Read filters in <strong>TShark</strong>, which allow you to select which packets
are to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields
are filterable in <strong>TShark</strong> than in other protocol analyzers, and the
syntax you can use to create your filters is richer.  As <strong>TShark</strong>
progresses, expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in read
filters.</p>
<p>Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  The capture filter
syntax follows the rules of the pcap library.  This syntax is different
from the read filter syntax.  A read filter can also be specified when
capturing, and only packets that pass the read filter will be displayed
or saved to the output file; note, however, that capture filters are much
more efficient than read filters, and it may be more difficult for
<strong>TShark</strong> to keep up with a busy network if a read filter is
specified for a live capture.</p>
<p>A capture or read filter can either be specified with the <strong>-f</strong> or <strong>-R</strong>
option, respectively, in which case the entire filter expression must be
specified as a single argument (which means that if it contains spaces,
it must be quoted), or can be specified with command-line arguments
after the option arguments, in which case all the arguments after the
filter arguments are treated as a filter expression.  Capture filters
are supported only when doing a live capture; read filters are supported
when doing a live capture and when reading a capture file, but require
TShark to do more work when filtering, so you might be more likely to
lose packets under heavy load if you're using a read filter.  If the
filter is specified with command-line arguments after the option
arguments, it's a capture filter if a capture is being done (i.e., if no
<strong>-r</strong> option was specified) and a read filter if a capture file is being
read (i.e., if a <strong>-r</strong> option was specified).</p>
<p>The <strong>-G</strong> option is a special mode that simply causes <strong>Tshark</strong> 
to dump one of several types of internal glossaries and then exit.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="options">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="a_capture_autostop_condition" class="item">-a  &lt;capture autostop condition&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Specify a criterion that specifies when <strong>TShark</strong> is to stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form <em>test</em><strong>:</strong><em>value</em>,
where <em>test</em> is one of:</p>
<p><strong>duration</strong>:<em>value</em> Stop writing to a capture file after <em>value</em> seconds
have elapsed.</p>
<p><strong>filesize</strong>:<em>value</em> Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
<em>value</em> kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024 bytes). If this option is used
together with the -b option, <strong>TShark</strong> will stop writing to the current
capture file and switch to the next one if filesize is reached. When reading a
capture file, <strong>TShark</strong> will stop reading the file after the number of bytes
read exceeds this number (the complete packet will be read, so more bytes than
this number may be read).</p>
<p><strong>files</strong>:<em>value</em> Stop writing to capture files after <em>value</em> number of files
were written.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="b_capture_ring_buffer_option" class="item">-b  &lt;capture ring buffer option&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Cause <strong>TShark</strong> to run in &quot;multiple files&quot; mode.  In &quot;multiple files&quot; mode,
<strong>TShark</strong> will write to several capture files. When the first capture file
fills up, <strong>TShark</strong> will switch writing to the next file and so on.</p>
<p>The created filenames are based on the filename given with the <strong>-w</strong> option,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,
e.g. outfile_00001_20050604120117.pcap, outfile_00002_20050604120523.pcap, ...</p>
<p>With the <em>files</em> option it's also possible to form a &quot;ring buffer&quot;.
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point <strong>TShark</strong> will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on. If the <em>files</em> option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).</p>
<p>The criterion is of the form <em>key</em><strong>:</strong><em>value</em>,
where <em>key</em> is one of:</p>
<p><strong>duration</strong>:<em>value</em> switch to the next file after <em>value</em> seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up.</p>
<p><strong>filesize</strong>:<em>value</em> switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
<em>value</em> kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024 bytes).</p>
<p><strong>files</strong>:<em>value</em> begin again with the first file after <em>value</em> number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The <strong>files</strong> criterion
requires either <strong>duration</strong> or <strong>filesize</strong> to be specified to control when to
go to the next file.  It should be noted that each <strong>-b</strong> parameter takes exactly
one criterion; to specify two criterion, each must be preceded by the <strong>-b</strong>
option.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-b filesize:1024 -b files:5</strong> results in a ring buffer of five files
of size one megabyte.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="b_capture_buffer_size" class="item">-B  &lt;capture buffer size&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Set capture buffer size (in MB, default is 1MB).  This is used by the
the capture driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk.  If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try to increase
this size.  Note that, while <strong>Tshark</strong> attempts to set the buffer size
to 1MB by default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the
system or interface on which you're capturing might silently limit the
capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.</p>
<p>This is available on on UNIX systems with libpcap 1.0.0 or later and on
Windows.  It is not available on UNIX systems with earlier versions of
libpcap.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="c_capture_packet_count" class="item">-c  &lt;capture packet count&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live
data. If reading a capture file, set the maximum number of packets to read.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="c_configuration_profile" class="item">-C  &lt;configuration profile&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Run with the given configuration profile.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="d_layer_type_selector_decode_as_protocol" class="item">-d  &lt;layer type&gt;==&lt;selector&gt;,&lt;decode-as protocol&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Like Wireshark's <strong>Decode As...</strong> feature, this lets you specify how a
layer type should be dissected. If the layer type in question (for example,
<strong>tcp.port</strong> or <strong>udp.port</strong> for a TCP or UDP port number) has the specified
selector value, packets should be dissected as the specified protocol.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-d tcp.port==8888,http</strong> will decode any traffic running over
TCP port 8888 as HTTP.</p>
<p>Using an invalid selector or protocol will print out a list of valid selectors
and protocol names, respectively.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-d .</strong> is a quick way to get a list of valid selectors.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-d ethertype==0x0800.</strong> is a quick way to get a list of protocols that can be
selected with an ethertype.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="d" class="item">-D</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Print a list of the interfaces on which <strong>TShark</strong> can capture, and
exit.  For each network interface, a number and an
interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the
interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be supplied
to the <strong>-i</strong> option to specify an interface on which to capture.</p>
<p>This can be useful on systems that don't have a command to list them
(e.g., Windows systems, or UNIX systems lacking <strong>ifconfig -a</strong>);
the number can be useful on Windows 2000 and later systems, where the
interface name is a somewhat complex string.</p>
<p>Note that &quot;can capture&quot; means that <strong>TShark</strong> was able to open that
device to do a live capture.  Depending on your system you may need to
run tshark from an account with special privileges (for example, as
root) to be able to capture network traffic.  If <strong>TShark -D</strong> is not run
from such an account, it will not list any interfaces.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="e_field" class="item">-e  &lt;field&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Add a field to the list of fields to display if <strong>-T fields</strong> is
selected.  This option can be used multiple times on the command line.
At least one field must be provided if the <strong>-T fields</strong> option is
selected.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-e frame.number -e ip.addr -e udp</strong></p>
<p>Giving a protocol rather than a single field will print multiple items
of data about the protocol as a single field.  Fields are separated by
tab characters by default.  <strong>-E</strong> controls the format of the printed
fields.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="e_field_print_option" class="item">-E  &lt;field print option&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Set an option controlling the printing of fields when <strong>-T fields</strong> is
selected.</p>
<p>Options are:</p>
<p><strong>header=y|n</strong> If <strong>y</strong>, print a list of the field names given using <strong>-e</strong>
as the first line of the output; the field name will be separated using
the same character as the field values.  Defaults to <strong>n</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>separator=/t|/s|</strong>&lt;character&gt; Set the separator character to
use for fields.  If <strong>/t</strong> tab will be used (this is the default), if
<strong>/s</strong>, a single space will be used.  Otherwise any character that can be
accepted by the command line as part of the option may be used.</p>
<p><strong>occurrence=f|l|a</strong> Select which occurrence to use for fields that have
multiple occurences.  If <strong>f</strong> the first occurrence will be used, if <strong>l</strong>
the last occurrence will be used and if <strong>a</strong> all occurrences will be used
(this is the default).</p>
<p><strong>aggregator=,|/s|</strong>&lt;character&gt; Set the aggregator character to
use for fields that have multiple occurences.  If <strong>,</strong> a comma will be used
(this is the default), if <strong>/s</strong>, a single space will be used.  Otherwise 
any character that can be accepted by the command line as part of the
option may be used.</p>
<p><strong>quote=d|s|n</strong> Set the quote character to use to surround fields.  <strong>d</strong>
uses double-quotes, <strong>s</strong> single-quotes, <strong>n</strong> no quotes (the default).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="f_capture_filter" class="item">-f  &lt;capture filter&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Set the capture filter expression.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="f_file_format" class="item">-F  &lt;file format&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Set the file format of the output capture file written using the <strong>-w</strong>
option.  The output written with the <strong>-w</strong> option is raw packet data, not
text, so there is no <strong>-F</strong> option to request text output.  The option <strong>-F</strong>
without a value will list the available formats.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="g_fields_fields2_fields3_protocols_values_decodes_defaultprefs_currentprefs" class="item">-G  [fields|fields2|fields3|protocols|values|decodes|defaultprefs|currentprefs]</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <strong>-G</strong> option will cause <strong>Tshark</strong> to dump one of several types of glossaries 
and then exit.  If no specfic glossary type if specified then the <strong>fields</strong> report 
will be generated by default.</p>
<p>The available report types include:</p>
<p><strong>fields</strong>  Dumps the contents of the registration database to 
stdout. An independent program can take this output and format it into nice 
tables or HTML or whatever.  There is one record per line. Each record is 
either a protocol or a header field, differentiated by the first field. 
The fields are tab-delimited.</p>
<pre>
 * Protocols
 * ---------
 * Field 1 = 'P'
 * Field 2 = descriptive protocol name
 * Field 3 = protocol abbreviation
 *
 * Header Fields
 * -------------
 * Field 1 = 'F'
 * Field 2 = descriptive field name
 * Field 3 = field abbreviation
 * Field 4 = type ( textual representation of the the ftenum type )
 * Field 5 = parent protocol abbreviation
 * Field 6 = blurb describing field</pre>
<p><strong>fields2</strong>  Same as the <strong>fields</strong> report but includes two additional columns.</p>
<pre>
 * Field 7 = base for display (for integer types); &quot;parent bitfield width&quot; for FT_BOOLEAN
 * Field 8 = blurb describing field (yes, apparently we repeated this accidentally)</pre>
<p><strong>fields3</strong>  Same as the <strong>fields</strong> report but includes two additional columns.</p>
<pre>
 * Field 7 = base for display (for integer types); &quot;parent bitfield width&quot; for FT_BOOLEAN
 * Field 8 = bitmask: format: hex: 0x....</pre>
<p><strong>protocols</strong> Dumps the protocols in the registration database to stdout.  
An independent program can take this output and format it into nice tables 
or HTML or whatever. There is one record per line. The fields are tab-delimited.</p>
<pre>
 * Field 1 = protocol name
 * Field 2 = protocol short name
 * Field 3 = protocol filter name</pre>
<p><strong>values</strong> Dumps the value_strings, range_strings or true/false strings 
for fields that have them. There is one record per line. Fields are 
tab-delimited.  There are three types of records: Value String, Range 
String and True/False String. The first field, 'V', 'R' or 'T', indicates
the type of record.</p>
<pre>
 * Value Strings
 * -------------
 * Field 1 = 'V'
 * Field 2 = field abbreviation to which this value string corresponds
 * Field 3 = Integer value
 * Field 4 = String

 * Field 3 = True String
 * Field 4 = False String</pre>
<p><strong>decodes</strong> Dumps the &quot;layer type&quot;/&quot;decode as&quot; associations to stdout. 
There is one record per line. The fields are tab-delimited.</p>
<pre>
 * Field 1 = layer type, e.g. &quot;tcp.port&quot;
 * Field 2 = selector in decimal
 * Field 3 = &quot;decode as&quot; name, e.g. &quot;http&quot;</pre>
<p><strong>defaultprefs</strong>  Dumps a default preferences file to stdout.</p>
<p><strong>currentprefs</strong>  Dumps a copy of the current preferences file to stdout.</p>

<p>Print the version and options and exits.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="i_capture_interface" class="item">-i  &lt;capture interface&gt; | -</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.</p>
<p>Network interface names should match one of the names listed in
&quot;<strong>tshark -D</strong>&quot; (described above); a number, as reported by
&quot;<strong>tshark -D</strong>&quot;, can also be used.  If you're using UNIX, &quot;<strong>netstat
-i</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>ifconfig -a</strong>&quot; might also work to list interface names,
although not all versions of UNIX support the <strong>-a</strong> option to <strong>ifconfig</strong>.</p>
<p>If no interface is specified, <strong>TShark</strong> searches the list of
interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if there are any
non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non-loopback interfaces. If there are no interfaces at all,
<strong>TShark</strong> reports an error and doesn't start the capture.</p>
<p>Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or ``-'' to
read data from the standard input.  Data read from pipes must be in
standard libpcap format.</p>
<p>Note: the Win32 version of <strong>TShark</strong> doesn't support capturing from
pipes!</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="i" class="item">-I</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Put the interface in &quot;monitor mode&quot;; this is supported only on IEEE
802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and supported only on some operating systems.</p>
<p>Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the
network with which it's associated, so that you will not be able to use
any wireless networks with that adapter.  This could prevent accessing
files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses,
if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another
network with another adapter.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="k_keytab" class="item">-K  &lt;keytab&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Load kerberos crypto keys from the specified keytab file.
This option can be used multiple times to load keys from several files.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-K krb5.keytab</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="l" class="item">-l</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Flush the standard output after the information for each packet is
printed.  (This is not, strictly speaking, line-buffered if <strong>-V</strong>
was specified; however, it is the same as line-buffered if <strong>-V</strong> wasn't
specified, as only one line is printed for each packet, and, as <strong>-l</strong> is
normally used when piping a live capture to a program or script, so that
output for a packet shows up as soon as the packet is seen and
dissected, it should work just as well as true line-buffering.  We do
this as a workaround for a deficiency in the Microsoft Visual C++ C
library.)</p>
<p>This may be useful when piping the output of <strong>TShark</strong> to another
program, as it means that the program to which the output is piped will
see the dissected data for a packet as soon as <strong>TShark</strong> sees the
packet and generates that output, rather than seeing it only when the
standard output buffer containing that data fills up.</p>
</dd>

reading a capture file and only want the statistics printed, not any

<p>Note that the <strong>-z proto</strong> option is different - it doesn't cause
statistics to be gathered and printed when the capture is complete, it
modifies the regular packet summary output to include the values of
fields specified with the option.  Therefore you must not use the <strong>-q</strong>
option, as that option would suppress the printing of the regular packet
summary output, and must also not use the <strong>-V</strong> option, as that would
cause packet detail information rather than packet summary information
to be printed.</p>
<p>Currently implemented statistics are:</p>

<p>Collect call/reply RTT data for DCERPC interface <em>uuid</em>,
version <em>major</em>.<em>minor</em>.
Data collected is the number of calls for each procedure, MinRTT, MaxRTT

<p>Example: <strong>-z&nbsp;dcerpc,rtt,12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ac,1.0</strong> will collect data for the CIFS SAMR Interface.</p>
<p>If the optional <em>filter</em> is provided, the stats will only be calculated
on those calls that match that filter.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-z&nbsp;dcerpc,rtt,12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ac,1.0,ip.addr==1.2.3.4</strong>

<p>Collect packet/bytes statistics for the capture in intervals of
<em>interval</em> seconds.  <em>Interval</em> can be specified either as a whole or
fractional second and can be specified with ms resolution.
If <em>interval</em> is 0, the statistics will be calculated over all packets.</p>
<p>If no <em>filter</em> is specified the statistics will be calculated for all packets.
If one or more <em>filters</em> are specified statistics will be calculated for
all filters and presented with one column of statistics for each filter.</p>
<p>This option can be used multiple times on the command line.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-z io,stat,1,ip.addr==1.2.3.4</strong> will generate 1 second
statistics for all traffic to/from host 1.2.3.4.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-z &quot;io,stat,0.001,smb&amp;&amp;ip.addr==1.2.3.4&quot;</strong> will generate 1ms
statistics for all SMB packets to/from host 1.2.3.4.</p>
<p>The examples above all use the standard syntax for generating statistics
which only calculates the number of packets and bytes in each interval.</p>
<p><strong>io,stat</strong> can also do much more statistics and calculate <code>COUNT()</code>, <code>SUM()</code>,
<code>MIN()</code>, <code>MAX()</code>, and <code>AVG()</code> using a slightly different filter syntax:</p>
<pre>
  [COUNT|SUM|MIN|MAX|AVG](&lt;field&gt;)&lt;filter&gt;</pre>
<p>NOTE: One important thing to note here is that the field that the
calculation is based on MUST also be part of the filter string or
else the calculation will fail.</p>
<p>So: <strong>-z io,stat,0.010,AVG(smb.time)</strong> does not work.  Use <strong>-z
io,stat,0.010,AVG(smb.time)smb.time</strong> instead.  Also be aware that a field
can exist multiple times inside the same packet and will then be counted
multiple times in those packets.</p>
<p>NOTE: A second important thing to note is that the system setting for
decimal separator is set to &quot;.&quot;! If it is set to &quot;,&quot; the statistics
will not be displayed per filter.</p>
<p>COUNT(&lt;field&gt;) can be used on any type which has a display filter name.
It will count how many times this particular field is encountered in the
filtered packet list.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-z io,stat,0.010,COUNT(smb.sid)smb.sid</strong></p>
<p>This will count the total number of SIDs seen in each 10ms interval.</p>
<p>SUM(&lt;field&gt;) can only be used on named fields of integer type.
This will sum together every occurence of this fields value for each interval.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>-z io,stat,0.010,SUM(frame.pkt_len)frame.pkt_len</strong></p>
<p>This will report the total number of bytes seen in all the packets within
an interval.</p>
<p>MIN/MAX/AVG(&lt;field&gt;) can only be used on named fields that are either
integers or relative time fields.  This will calculate maximum/minimum
or average seen in each interval.  If the field is a relative time field
the output will be presented in seconds and three digits after the
decimal point.  The resolution for time calculations is 1ms and anything
smaller will be truncated.</p>
<p>Example:  <strong>-z &quot;io,stat,0.010,smb.time&amp;&amp;ip.addr==1.1.1.1,MIN(smb.time)smb.time&amp;&amp;ip.addr==1.1.1.1,MAX(smb.time)smb.time&amp;&amp;ip.addr==1.1.1.1,MAX(smb.time)smb.time&amp;&amp;ip.addr==1.1.1.1&quot;</strong></p>
<p>This will calculate statistics for all smb response times we see to/from
host 1.1.1.1 in 10ms intervals.  The output will be displayed in 4
columns; number of packets/bytes, minimum response time, maximum response
time and average response time.</p>

in addition to the normal content of that column.
<em>field</em> is the display-filter name of a field which value should be placed
in the Info column.
<em>filter</em> is a filterstring that controls for which packets the field value
will be presented in the info column. <em>field</em> will only be presented in the

<p>NOTE: In order for <strong>TShark</strong> to be able to extract the <em>field</em> value

  &quot;resp_time&quot;    response time in seconds, '0' in case if matched Request/Answer is not found in trace. E.g. in the begin or end of capture.</pre>
<p><strong>-z diameter,avp</strong> option is much faster than <strong>-V -T text</strong> or <strong>-T pdml</strong> options.</p>

<h1><a name="files">FILES</a></h1>
<p>These files contains various <strong>Wireshark</strong> configuration values.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="preferences" class="item">Preferences</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <em class="file">preferences</em> files contain global (system-wide) and personal
preference settings. If the system-wide preference file exists, it is
read first, overriding the default settings. If the personal preferences
file exists, it is read next, overriding any previous values. Note: If
the command line option <strong>-o</strong> is used (possibly more than once), it will
in turn override values from the preferences files.</p>
<p>The preferences settings are in the form <em>prefname</em><strong>:</strong><em>value</em>,
one per line,
where <em>prefname</em> is the name of the preference
and <em>value</em> is the value to
which it should be set; white space is allowed between <strong>:</strong> and
<em>value</em>.  A preference setting can be continued on subsequent lines by
indenting the continuation lines with white space.  A <strong>#</strong> character
starts a comment that runs to the end of the line:</p>
<pre>
  # Capture in promiscuous mode?
  # TRUE or FALSE (case-insensitive).
  capture.prom_mode: TRUE</pre>
<p>The global preferences file is looked for in the <em class="file">wireshark</em> directory
under the <em class="file">share</em> subdirectory of the main installation directory (for
example, <em class="file">/usr/local/share/wireshark/preferences</em>) on UNIX-compatible
systems, and in the main installation directory (for example,
<em class="file">C:\Program Files\Wireshark\preferences</em>) on Windows systems.</p>
<p>The personal preferences file is looked for in
<em class="file">$HOME/.wireshark/preferences</em> on
UNIX-compatible systems and <em class="file">%APPDATA%\Wireshark\preferences</em> (or, if
%APPDATA% isn't defined, <em class="file">%USERPROFILE%\Application
Data\Wireshark\preferences</em>) on Windows systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="disabled" class="item">Disabled (Enabled) Protocols</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <em class="file">disabled_protos</em> files contain system-wide and personal lists of
protocols that have been disabled, so that their dissectors are never
called.  The files contain protocol names, one per line, where the
protocol name is the same name that would be used in a display filter
for the protocol:</p>
<pre>
  http
  tcp     # a comment</pre>
<p>The global <em class="file">disabled_protos</em> file uses the same directory as the global
preferences file.</p>
<p>The personal <em class="file">disabled_protos</em> file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="resolution" class="item">Name Resolution (hosts)</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>If the personal <em class="file">hosts</em> file exists, it is
used to resolve IPv4 and IPv6 addresses before any other
attempts are made to resolve them.  The file has the standard <em class="file">hosts</em>
file syntax; each line contains one IP address and name, separated by
whitespace. The same directory as for the personal preferences file is
used.</p>
<p>Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible
systems and WinPCAP on Windows.  As such the Wireshark personal <em class="file">hosts</em> file
will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Name Resolution (ethers)</strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <em class="file">ethers</em> files are consulted to correlate 6-byte hardware addresses to
names. First the personal <em class="file">ethers</em> file is tried and if an address is not
found there the global <em class="file">ethers</em> file is tried next.</p>
<p>Each line contains one hardware address and name, separated by
whitespace.  The digits of the hardware address are separated by colons
(:), dashes (-) or periods (.).  The same separator character must be
used consistently in an address. The following three lines are valid
lines of an <em class="file">ethers</em> file:</p>
<pre>
  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff          Broadcast
  c0-00-ff-ff-ff-ff          TR_broadcast
  00.00.00.00.00.00          Zero_broadcast</pre>
<p>The global <em class="file">ethers</em> file is looked for in the <em class="file">/etc</em> directory on
UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, <em class="file">C:\Program Files\Wireshark</em>) on Windows systems.</p>
<p>The personal <em class="file">ethers</em> file is looked for in the same directory as the personal
preferences file.</p>
<p>Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible
systems and WinPCAP on Windows.  As such the Wireshark personal <em class="file">ethers</em> file
will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Name Resolution (manuf)</strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <em class="file">manuf</em> file is used to match the 3-byte vendor portion of a 6-byte
hardware address with the manufacturer's name; it can also contain well-known
MAC addresses and address ranges specified with a netmask.  The format of the
file is the same as the <em class="file">ethers</em> files, except that entries of the form:</p>
<pre>
  00:00:0C      Cisco</pre>
<p>can be provided, with the 3-byte OUI and the name for a vendor, and
entries such as:</p>
<pre>
  00-00-0C-07-AC/40     All-HSRP-routers</pre>
<p>can be specified, with a MAC address and a mask indicating how many bits
of the address must match. The above entry, for example, has 40
significant bits, or 5 bytes, and would match addresses from
00-00-0C-07-AC-00 through 00-00-0C-07-AC-FF. The mask need not be a
multiple of 8.</p>
<p>The <em class="file">manuf</em> file is looked for in the same directory as the global
preferences file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Name Resolution (ipxnets)</strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <em class="file">ipxnets</em> files are used to correlate 4-byte IPX network numbers to
names. First the global <em class="file">ipxnets</em> file is tried and if that address is not
found there the personal one is tried next.</p>
<p>The format is the same as the <em class="file">ethers</em>
file, except that each address is four bytes instead of six.
Additionally, the address can be represented as a single hexadecimal
number, as is more common in the IPX world, rather than four hex octets.
For example, these four lines are valid lines of an <em class="file">ipxnets</em> file:</p>
<pre>
  C0.A8.2C.00              HR
  c0-a8-1c-00              CEO
  00:00:BE:EF              IT_Server1
  110f                     FileServer3</pre>
<p>The global <em class="file">ipxnets</em> file is looked for in the <em class="file">/etc</em> directory on
UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, <em class="file">C:\Program Files\Wireshark</em>) on Windows systems.</p>
<p>The personal <em class="file">ipxnets</em> file is looked for in the same directory as the
personal preferences file.</p>

<dd>
<p>Normally per-packet memory is allocated in large &quot;chunks.&quot;  This behavior
doesn't work well with debugging tools such as Valgrind or ElectricFence.
Export this environment variable to force individual allocations.
Note: disabling chunks also disables canaries (see below).</p>

<dt><strong><a name="wireshark_debug_se_no_chunks" class="item">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_SE_NO_CHUNKS</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Normally per-file memory is allocated in large &quot;chunks.&quot;  This behavior
doesn't work well with debugging tools such as Valgrind or ElectricFence.
Export this environment variable to force individual allocations.
Note: disabling chunks also disables canaries (see below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="wireshark_debug_ep_no_canary" class="item">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_EP_NO_CANARY</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Normally per-packet memory allocations are separated by &quot;canaries&quot; which
allow detection of memory overruns.  This comes at the expense of some extra
memory usage.  Exporting this environment variable disables these canaries.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="wireshark_debug_se_use_canary" class="item">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_SE_USE_CANARY</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Exporting this environment variable causes per-file memory allocations to be
protected with &quot;canaries&quot; which allow for detection of memory overruns.
This comes at the expense of significant extra memory usage.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="wireshark_debug_scrub_memory" class="item">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_SCRUB_MEMORY</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is exported, the contents of per-packet and
per-file memory is initialized to 0xBADDCAFE when the memory is allocated
and is reset to 0xDEADBEEF when the memory is freed.  This functionality is
useful mainly to developers looking for bugs in the way memory is handled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="wireshark_run_from_build_directory" class="item">WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be loaded
from the build directory (where the program was compiled) rather than from the
standard locations.  It has no effect when the program in question is running
with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="wireshark_data_dir" class="item">WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="wireshark_python_dir" class="item">WIRESHARK_PYTHON_DIR</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This environment variable points to an alternate location for Python.
It has no effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
permissions on *NIX.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="erf_records_to_check" class="item">ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This environment variable controls the number of ERF records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the ERF format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="wireshark_abort_on_dissector_bug" class="item">WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set, <strong>TShark</strong> will call <code>abort(3)</code>
when a dissector bug is encountered.  <code>abort(3)</code> will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running <strong>TShark</strong> in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.</p>
